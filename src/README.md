#val town raycast extension
This is a simple Raycast extension that allows one to fetch information about Vals from val.town using their new API. All that you need to bring is a val.town API key. 

Currently there are two commands:

- Fetch Val by Name (requires both username and val name to be input)
- Fetch Val by ID (requires a val's unique ID to be input)

In addition, you can copy or open directly the run and express endpoints for vals.
